Just define the image URL in the contentâ€™s front matter, the featured image will be displayed as the background. 

For example:

```yaml
---

```

```Python
print hola
```

This is an array, you can set multiple urls, only the first url will be used. These images is also used in [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started.html) and the [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) metadata.
